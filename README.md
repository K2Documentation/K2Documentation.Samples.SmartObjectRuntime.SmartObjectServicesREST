K2 can expose SmartObjects as RESTful services that expose SmartObject methods as REST service endpoints. This API is mostly used when developers want to interact with SmartObjects in a technology other than .NET (for example, jQuery) or do not wish to add a reference to a service to their .NET project.

This project contains sample code that demonstrates the basic use of the SmartObjects REST services:
* Create a web request to the REST server endpoint for the "Get Process Instance Detail" method of the "Workflow Instance Report" SmartObject 
* Process and output the results ot the console

## Prerequisites
* .NET Assemblies (both assemblies are included with K2 client-side tools install and are also included in the project's References folder)
  * None for this project

## Getting started
* Use these code snippets to learn about the basic use of the SmartObjects REST services.
* Note that as this project is only sample code, it may compile but will not actually run as-is. You will need to edit the code snippets to work in your environment and with your artifacts.
* Fetch or Pull the appropriate branch of this project for your version of K2.
* Consider the Master branch the latest, up-to-date version of the sample project. Branches contain older versions. For example, there may be a branch called K2-Five-5.0 that is specific to K2 Five version 5.0. There may be another branch called K2-Five-5.3 that is specific to K2 Five version 5.3. Assume that the master branch represents the latest release version of K2 Five.
* The Visual Studio project contains a folder called "References" where you can find the referenced .NET assemblies or other uncommon assemblies. By default, try to reference these assemblies from your own environment for consistency, but we provide the referenced assemblies as a convenience in case you are not able to locate or use the referenced assemblies in your environment.
* The Visual Studio project contains a folder called "Resources". This folder contains additional resources that may be required to use the same code, such as K2 deployment packages, sample files, SQL scripts and so on.
